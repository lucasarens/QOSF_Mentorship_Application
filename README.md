# QOSF_Mentorship_Application

#### Dear evaluator,

My main solution is on the jupyter notebook Task1_Lucas_Arenstein.ipynb .
I think this is the fastest way to grade my solution.

But if you don't want to use jupyter and just want to read my report you could go to Task1_Lucas_Arenstein.html

To run the code in a terminal for the task 1 just type:

python3 Task1_Bonus_Solution1.py [1,5,7,10]

and to run the script with any input you desire (bonus part) just run:

python3 Task1_Bonus_Solution1.py [1,2,3,...,2^n] 

if you want to try the Solution 2 run: python3 Task1_Bonus_Solution2.py [1,2,3,...,2^n] on the terminal.

And finally you can run this codes in a IDE, using this option you will see the expected answer and the histograms aswell.
running the function sol1_bonus([1,2,3,4...]).


#### Thank you for your time and opportunity :)
